== How to add lessons?
Use DemoDataGenerator.class

== How to change constraints?
Use TimeTableConstraintProvider.class to edit the constraints.

==== Some tips how to start with that:
- First join lessons with themselves by time or whatever variable you are interested in as if it was a SQL request.
- Next define the filtering cause which of the cases you want to penalize.
- Then think about what kind a constraints you want to add Hard or Soft. Is the rule obligatory or not?
